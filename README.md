This project was built with LAMP stack for the impact week at Restart Network as a team work. 
The website was made for Stichting Hospice Amsterdam, a NGO based at Amsterdam providing healthcare for patients who don't have a place to stay.
We made the website more convenient to attract donators and volunteers by:
- Providing the online form for volunteer be able to register and submit it instead of printing out the registration form and mail it to Hospice.
- Redesigning the logo of the organisation and layout of the website;
- Creating admin page for the organisation be able to update their activities and show them on the website to donators.
